###  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):

* AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 

* With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials (like access keys), and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access. 

* It is the fundamental service for managing authentication and authorization in your AWS environment.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Users:** Individual identities for people or applications that need to interact with AWS.

* **Groups:** Collections of IAM users. Permissions assigned to a group are inherited by all users in that group.

* **Roles:** Identities that you can assume to get temporary security credentials. Roles are used for granting permissions to AWS services, cross-account access, and federated users.

* **Policies:** Documents that define permissions. They can be inline (embedded in a user, group, or role) or managed (reusable policies that can be attached to multiple entities).

* **Identity-based policies:** Attach to an IAM identity (user, group, or role) and grant permissions to that identity.

* **Resource-based policies:** Attach to a resource (e.g., S3 bucket, SQS queue) and control who can access that resource.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security for user sign-in.

* **IAM Access Analyzer:** Helps identify resources that are shared with an external entity.

* **Permissions Boundaries:** Advanced feature to set the maximum permissions an identity-based policy can grant.

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS):

* AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. 

* It is integrated with many other AWS services to simplify the encryption of data at rest. 

* KMS keys are protected by FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs).

#### Key Concepts:

* **Customer Master Keys (CMKs):** The primary logical key in KMS used to encrypt or decrypt data. Can be AWS-managed or customer-managed.

* **Data Keys:** Keys generated by KMS and used to encrypt your actual data. CMKs encrypt and decrypt these data keys.

* **Envelope Encryption:** The process of encrypting data with a data key, and then encrypting the data key with a CMK.

* **Integration with AWS Services:** Many AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS, Lambda, etc.) can be configured to use KMS for encryption.

### AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF):

* AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs from common web exploits that could affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. 

* You can configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions you specify.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Web Access Control List (Web ACL):** A collection of rules that defines how AWS WAF inspects web requests.

* **Rules:** Define the conditions that AWS WAF looks for in web requests (e.g., IP addresses, HTTP headers, query strings, SQL injection patterns, cross-site scripting).

* **Rule Groups:** Reusable sets of rules that you can manage or subscribe to from AWS Managed Rules or AWS Marketplace sellers.

* **Associated Resources:** WAF can protect Amazon CloudFront distributions, Application Load Balancers (ALBs), Amazon API Gateway REST APIs, and AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs.

* **Rate-based Rules:** Automatically block or limit traffic from IP addresses that exceed a configured request threshold.

### AWS Shield:

* AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. 

* It provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency.

#### Key Concepts:

* **AWS Shield Standard:** Automatically applies to all AWS customers at no additional cost, protecting against common, most frequent network and transport layer DDoS attacks.

* **AWS Shield Advanced:** Provides enhanced protections against larger and more sophisticated DDoS attacks for your AWS resources (EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53). It includes 24/7 access to the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) and cost protection against DDoS-related scaling charges.

### Amazon GuardDuty:

* Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. 

* It uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify potential threats.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Analyzes AWS CloudTrail events, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

* **Security Findings:** Generates detailed security findings when potential threats are detected, categorized by severity.

* **Threat Intelligence:** Uses continually updated threat intelligence feeds from AWS and third-party partners.

* **Integration:** Can send findings to AWS Security Hub, Amazon EventBridge, and other security tools for further action.

<hr style="border: 0; height: 3px; background: #0078D4; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;">

### AWS Security Hub:

* AWS Security Hub provides a comprehensive view of your security alerts and security posture across your AWS accounts. 

* It collects security data from various AWS services (like GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, WAF) and AWS partner solutions, and then helps you analyze and act on the findings.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Centralized Security Findings:** Aggregates findings from multiple sources into a single, standardized format.

* **Security Standards:** Performs automated security checks against industry best practices and compliance standards (e.g., AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark).

* **Insights:** Provides actionable insights by correlating and prioritizing security findings.

* **Automated Remediation:** Integrates with services like Amazon EventBridge and AWS Systems Manager Automation to enable automated responses to findings.

### AWS CloudTrail:

* AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. 

* It records API calls and related events made by or on behalf of an AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Event History:** Provides a view of the last 90 days of activity in your AWS account.

* **Trails:** Configurable logging for events, which can be delivered to an S3 bucket for long-term storage and analysis.

* **Management Events:** Log management operations performed on resources (e.g., creating an EC2 instance, modifying an S3 bucket policy).

* **Data Events:** Log resource operations performed on or within a resource (e.g., S3 object-level API activity, Lambda function invocations).

* **CloudTrail Lake:** A managed data lake for auditing and security analysis of CloudTrail events.

### Amazon Cognito:

* Amazon Cognito provides identity management for your web and mobile applications. 

* It enables you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your apps quickly and easily, supporting millions of users.

#### Key Concepts:

* **User Pools:** User directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your application users. They can manage user profiles, multi-factor authentication, and integration with social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) or enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML, OIDC).

* **Identity Pools (Federated Identities):** Enable your users to obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) and grant access to other services directly.

* **Authentication:** Manages the process of verifying user identities.

* **Authorization:** Grants authenticated users permissions to access AWS resources.
